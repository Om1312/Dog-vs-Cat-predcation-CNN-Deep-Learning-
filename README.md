🐶🐱 Dog vs Cat Image Classification

A Deep Learning project that classifies images as Dog or Cat using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Streamlit web application.

📌 Project Overview

This project builds and trains a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras on a dataset of cat and dog images.
A Streamlit web app is included that allows you to upload any image and get an instant prediction.

🚀 Features

✔ Train a CNN model using 20,000 training images
✔ Test using 5,000 images
✔ Model achieves high accuracy after training
✔ Streamlit app for real-time image prediction
✔ Easy drag-and-drop image upload
✔ Clean UI with probability score
✔ Supports .h5 or new .keras model format
✔ Works on Windows, Linux, Streamlit Cloud, etc.
